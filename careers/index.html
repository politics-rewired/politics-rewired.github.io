    Politics Rewired is a small worker-owned cooperative designing human and technological solutions for organizers. 
    We work with organizers to streamline workflows so that they can focus on what they do best: 
    building systems and relationships. We work with political campaigns, unions, and movement organizations, 
    with a deliberate emphasis on supporting Left insurgents and building independent Left infrastructure.
