  <h1> How We Make Decisions about Clients </h1>
  <p>
    We are not a politically neutral tech vendor. We want our tools to be used to grow the Left into a force that can
    challenge political and economic elites and build a society that works for the many, not the few. In practice,
    that means being selective about the candidates and organizations with whom we work.
  </p>

  <p>
    For political campaigns, we have a simple rule of thumb:
    Work with the leftmost viable candidate in any given race. In a partisan general election, this
    virtually always means the Democrat running against a Republican. In a Democratic or nonpartisan primary election
    or top-two runoff election, this often means an insurgent progressive or socialist candidate running against a
    more establishment centrist or conservative candidate.
  </p>

  <p>
    Our process is straightforward: Every time we receive a new client request from a candidate’s campaign,
    we research the race and ask ourselves three questions:
  <ol>
    <li>
      Do they have the most progressive platform?
    </li>
    <li>
      Do they have the most movement support?
    </li>
    <li>
      Are they viable?
    </li>
  </ol>
  </p>

  <p>
    Based on the answers, our team decides whether to approve the candidate as a client or not.
  </p>

  <p>
    For political organizations, we evaluate their mission, their membership, and their methods.
    We’re excited to support movement organizations building bottom-up power for popular demands, and
    encourage the use of our tool for meaningful connections and asks, rather than spam.
    There are countless different kinds of organizations, and just as we do with candidates, we research each one with
    care.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    There’s no magic formula for making these decisions, many of which are quite complex.
    Our commitment is to consider anyone interested in working with us and to follow a principled process that
    ensures that we lead with our politics and stay true to our goal of building a more just, free, and equal world.
