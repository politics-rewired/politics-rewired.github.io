  <h1> How We Make Decisions about Clients </h1>
  <p>
    We are not a politically neutral tech vendor.
    We want to see our tools be used to grow the Left into a force that can challenge political and economic elites and
    win a society that works for the many,
    not the few. Part of what that means in practice is being selective about who we work with.
  </p>

  <p>
    For political campaigns, we have a simple rule of thumb: work with the leftmost viable candidate in any given race.
    In a partisan general election, this virtually always means the Democrat running against a Republican.
    In a Democratic or nonpartisan primary election, or top-two runoff election, this often means an insurgent
    progressive or socialist candidate running against a more establishment centrist or conservative candidate.
  </p>

  <p>
    Our process is straightforward: every time we receive a new client request from a candidate’s campaign, we research
    the race
    and ask ourselves three questions:
  <ol>
    <li>
      Do they have the most progressive platform?
    </li>
    <li>
      Do they have the most movement support?
    </li>
    <li>
      Are they viable?
    </li>
  </ol>
  </p>

  <p>
    Based on the answers to those questions, we make a decision whether or not to approve the candidate as a client.
  </p>

  <p>
    For political or movement organizations, we look at their mission, their membership, and their methods.
    We’re excited to support movement organizations building bottom-up power for popular demands,
    while we’re not too keen on backing organizations that simply spam their lists with disingenuous fundraising
    appeals.
    There are countless different kinds of organizations and just like with candidates, we research each one that
    requests to be our client.
  </p>

  <p>
    There’s no magic formula for making these decisions and no shortage of complexity for many that we consider.
    Our commitment is to follow a principled process that ensures that we lead with our politics.
  </p>
