    - Spoke Rewired offers a low-cost, out-of-the-box solution for your team members to text a massive audience. Based on the open-source Spoke application, Spoke Rewired features a simple messaging application for efficient texting and automated tools to manage your contact lists.
    - Use the same software powering the Bernie Sanders 2020 texting program. We’ll host your instance of Spoke Rewired at no additional cost, saving you time, money, and headaches. After you run a texting campaign, we can help you analyze its success in delivering messages.
sections:
  - title: Messaging Application
    content: Send event information, links, and images to voters, volunteers, and donors. Conversations requiring texter action automatically appear in their to-do lists. Texters can easily opt-out contacts or escalate trickier conversations to an administrator.

  - title: Contact Validation
